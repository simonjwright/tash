<h1>TASH</h1>

<p><b>T</b>cl<b>A</b>da<b>SH</b>ell is an Ada binding to Tcl/Tk.

<p>This is a temporary description; the previous description (from the
original developer's hosting site, no longer extant)
is <a href="index.htm">here</a>.

<h2>Skinny Tcl Binding</h2>

<p>TASH includes both <i>skinny</i> and <i>medium</i> bindings to
Tcl. The skinny binding is a direct translation of the public Tcl
interface, <tt>tcl.h</tt>.  It is implemented in the Ada
package <tt>Tcl</tt>. It includes all the definitions
in <tt>tcl.h</tt>, both functions and data types.  All data types are
implemented with Ada equivalents from <tt>Interfaces.C</tt>.  All
functions take C data types and use return codes for status
information.

<h2>Medium Tcl Binding</h2>

<p>In addition to the skinny binding, TASH provides a medium binding
to Tcl.  This binding replaces C data types with Ada types
(e.g. <tt>String</tt> is used in place
of <tt>Interfaces.C.Strings.chars_ptr</tt>), uses exceptions in place
of return codes and uses generic packages to implement
Tcl <i>clientdata</i> types.

<h2>The TASHELL Interpreter</h2>

<p>The Tcl distribution includes a Tcl shell interpreter,
named <tt>tclsh</tt>.  The TASH binding derives its name from the Ada
version of the Tcl shell
interpreter: <b>T</b>cl <b>A</b>da <b>SH</b>ell.  Just
like <tt>tclsh</tt>, <tt>tashell</tt> reads and interprets a Tcl
script.  It is also a good starting point for building a custom Tcl
interpreter in which new Tcl commands are implemented in Ada rather
than C.

<p>An early paper describing the rationale of the design of TASH is
available in several different formats in
the <a href="http://tcladashell.sourceforge.net/docs.htm#intro">docs</a>
directory.

<h2>Skinny Tk Binding</h2>

<p>TASH includes both <i>skinny</i> and <i>medium</i> bindings to
Tk. The skinny binding is a direct translation of the public Tk
interface, <tt>tk.h</tt>, and is implemented in the Ada
package, <tt>Tcl.Tk</tt>.

<h2>Medium Tk Binding</h2>

<p>An early, experimental medium binding to Tk is provided in the Ada
package, <tt>Tcl.Tk.Ada</tt>.  This binding does not support all Tk
widgets and has not yet been upgraded to take advantage of the new
TASH thick binding or the Tcl object system.

<h2>The TWASHELL Interpreter</h2>

<p>TWASHELL is
the <b>T</b>cl <b>W</b>indowing <b>A</b>da <b>SH</b>ell. It is the Ada
version of the Tcl/Tk <tt>wish</tt> program. Just like <tt>wish</tt>,
it reads and interprets a Tcl/Tk script. It is also a starting point
for building a custom Tcl/Tk interpreter in which new Tcl/Tk commands
are implemented in Ada rather than C.

<p>An early paper describing how TWASHELL is a Platform-Independent
toolkit for development of Graphical User Interfaces is available in
several different formats in
the <a href="http://tcladashell.sourceforge.net/docs.htm#pigui">docs</a>
directory.

<h2>Unsupported features</h2>

<p>The original TASH included a <a href="tash.htm">'new thick
binding'</a>. Unfortunately, this is not supportable in Tcl/Tk 8.5 and
later, because it relies on what is now the private implementation of
commands such as <tt>file</tt>, <tt>list</tt>.

<p>The thick binding will be built if TASH is installed over Tcl/Tk
8.4 or earlier. However, it will be as well not to rely on its
continued availability (for example, Mac OS X Leopard had Tcl/Tk 8.4,
but Snow Leopard has 8.5).

<p>The GUI
developer <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/rapid/">RAPID</a>
does <i>not</i> depend on these unsupported features.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Extract TASH</h3>

<p>Choose a place to build TASH. If you're not using GNAT GPL or
FSF GCC, this should be the place you intend to use it from, perhaps
your HOME directory.

<p>Assuming this is your home directory, go there and extract TASH by
<pre>
  $ unzip tash-8.6-0-src-20110917.zip
</pre>

<p>and then enter the source directory:
<pre>
  $ cd tash-8.6-0-src-20110917
</pre>

<h3>Configure</h3>

Configure for your system:
<pre>
  $ ./setup.tcl
</pre>

<p>If Tcl/Tk was installed correctly, and <tt>wish</tt> is in your
path, a <tt>wish</tt> script will run which sets values for several
makefile macros used to customize your TASH build. In most cases, the
default values will be OK. If not, type in the correct values. It's
important that the C compiler used to compile glue files is compatible
with your Ada compiler; one way of achieving this (if you're using
GNAT; note, these instructions assume that's the case) is to make sure
that GNAT is first on your path. In any case, setup.tcl will use
'gnatgcc' if found.

<p>Press the Save button to create the <tt>tash_options.gpr</tt>
and <tt>makeconf</tt> files.

<p>You can say
<pre>
  $ ./setup.tcl --nogui
</pre>
if you're prepared to accept the defaults.

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Run
<pre>
  $ make all
</pre>

<p>This will compile the necessary C glue files and build the TASH
library as a static library (<tt>libtash.a</tt>) with
<tt>.ali</tt> files in <tt>lib/</tt>, and the corresponding Ada source
files in <tt>include/</tt>.

<h3>Run tests</h3>

<p>Run
<pre>
  $ make test
</pre>

<p>This runs several test programs in
the <tt>test/</tt>, <tt>demos/</tt> and, with Tcl/Tk
8.4, <tt>apps/</tt> directories.

<h3>Using TASH</h3>

<p>If you're using a GNAT-based compiler, it's <em>strongly</em> recommended
that you use
the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.0/gnat_ugn_unw/GNAT-Project-Manager.html">GNAT
Project</a> feature.

<h4>Using in-place</h4>

<p>After the <tt>make all</tt> stage, you can use TASH where it was
built with any GNAT-based compiler.

<p>Make sure that the TASH distribution directory is on your
<tt>ADA_PROJECT_PATH</tt>, by eg
<pre>
  $ export ADA_PROJECT_PATH=~/tash-8.6-0-src-20110917:$ADA_PROJECT_PATH
</pre>

<p>Your GPR should include TASH:
<pre>
  with "tash";
</pre>

<h4>Installing with the compiler</h4>

<p>If you're using FSF GCC or GNAT GPL, the best way is to install
TASH alongside your compiler. <em>Note, this does not work with
Debian</em> (yet), because of its different approach to file system
layout for the Ada subsystem.

<p>The remaining instructions assume use on a Unix machine, or Cygwin
if on Windows.

<p>Having run <tt>make all</tt> as above,
<pre>
   $ make install
</pre>
(you may need to do this as root on Unix systems).
