<h3>8.3.1b, 01-Oct-2000</h3>

<P> TASH version 8.3.1b supports Tcl/Tk version 8.3.1 and was compiled
with GNAT 3.12p. See the <A
HREF="http://dev.scriptics.com/software/8.3.html">Scriptics Tcl/Tk</A>
site for information on new features Tcl/Tk 8.3.1.</P>

<p> First full release of the TASH thick binding to Tcl.  For more
information on this new binding, see <a href="tash.htm">Introduction
to TASH</a>. If you have been using the preliminary thick binding,
note that TASH object types string, integer and float
were removed in favor of using Ada string, generic integer and
float types.</p>

<p> TASH is now available with pre-compiled Windows binary libraries
(libtcl82.a and libtk82.a).</p>

<p> Removed the <b>lib</b> directory which was used as a GNAT
Ada library in order to simplify the build procedures.  You can
still build a GNAT library yourself by copying the .ali, .ads,
and .o files to a separate directory.</p>

<p> Removed extra import of <b>Tcl_SetResult</b> in <b>tcl.ads</b>.</p>

<h3>8.2.0a, 15-Nov-1999</h3>

<P> TASH version 8.2.0a supports Tcl/Tk version 8.2.  See the <A
HREF="http://dev.scriptics.com/software/8.2.html">Scriptics Tcl/Tk</A>
site for information on new features Tcl/Tk 8.2.</P>

<P> The big news in this release is that the preliminary version of
the new thick binding to Tcl is available. There are thick bindings
for Tcl integers, floats, strings, lists, and regular
expressions. Access to the Tcl interpreter is now task-safe through
use of a protected type. Also, all TASH objects (integers, floats,
strings, and lists) are controlled types so memory is properly freed
when you leave scope or there are no more references to an object.</P>

<P> TASH now builds a TASH library.  This library is made up of a Unix-style
archive file and all the .ali and .ads files necessary to build TASH
applications. Note this applies only to GNAT compilations.</P>

<P> Upon initial setup of TASH, you may now choose whether to use the
popular &quot;pragma Linker_Options&quot; method for specifying linker
options.  Or, you may choose to have the linker options on the command
lines.  The setup script customizes the makefiles for the method
you've chosen.  Even if you don't use the makefiles for building TASH,
you can still take advantage of the creation of the TASH linker
options package.</P>
	   
<P> For those who might still be using older versions of Tcl/Tk (for
example, at my place of employment, we're still stuck at 7.6/4.2!), <A
HREF="download.htm#Archive">older versions of TASH</A> are now
available online.</P>
	   
<h3>8.0.2, 02-Jun-1998</h3>

<p>Minor fixes to the TASH web site pages.  No code changes.</p>

<h3>8.0.1, 22-May-1998</h3>

<p>Upgraded Windows 95 version to Tcl/Tk 8.0.</p>

<p>Improved test and demo directory makefiles to remove
Unix dependencies on commands deroff and diff.  This
was done by writing the Ada programs, wordify and compare.
Now, Win95 users can use these programs to verify that
the test and demo programs are working properly.</p>

<p>Added a thin binding to Tk in package <b>Tcl.Tk</b>.
This implements an almost complete binding to <b>tk.h</b>.
I say &quot;almost&quot; because references to X data types and all
subprograms which use them have <strong>not</strong>
been implemented.</p>

<p>The thick binding to Tk has now been moved to package <b>Tcl.Tk.Ada</b>
to accomodate the thin binding in package <b>Tcl.Tk</b>.
Unfortunately, this will force you to change a few references
to <b>Tcl.Tk</b> to reference <b>Tcl.Tk.Ada</b> instead.</p>

<p>Bug Fix: Corrected procedure Free in cargv.adb. It was going
into a recursive loop calling itself from which it could
never return.</p>

<p>Bug Fix: Corrected function &quot;&amp;&quot; in cargv.adb.
It was not correctly constructing the concatenated array
of strings.</p>

<h3>8.0.0, 16-Sep-1997</h3>

<p>Upgraded to Tcl/Tk 8.0</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this release does not yet support Windows 95.  You
must use version 7.6.1 for Windows 95.</p>

<p>Removed Tcl_Alloc, Tcl_Free, and Tcl_Realloc in the entire
binding: we don't want Tcl going about allocating and freeing
memory beyond Ada's control</p>
 
<p>Bug Fix: Corrected function &quot;=&quot; renames in cargv.adb </p>

<p>Bug Fix: Changed several references to Widget(Buttn) in tcl-tk.adb to
Widget'Class(Buttn)</p>

<p>Bug Fix: Referenced deallocated memory in twash</p>

<p>Changed the way Ada strings are converted to C strings in
tcl-ada.adb to reduce memory leaks</p>

<h3>7.6.1, 16-Sep-1997</h3>

<p>First version to support Windows 95.</p>

<p>Even so, there are still problems: twash.exe is not
interactive and both tash.exe and twash.exe crash when they are
terminated.</p>

<h3>7.6.0, 25-Nov-1996</h3>

<p>This version of TASH is compatible with Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2. </p>

<p>Changed version numbering system to include the Tcl version with
which TASH is compatible. </p>

<p>Converted to two layer binding in which &quot;thin&quot; binding
is in the package Tcl and the &quot;thick&quot; binding is in the
package &quot;Tcl.Ada.&quot; This makes it easier to keep up with
the latest version of Tcl because the Tcl package is now a direct
translation from tcl.h. It also makes disambiguation of overloaded
calls easier since they are now in different packages. </p>

<p>Now using an automatic tcl.h header file to Ada translator. This
is not a general purpose C to Ada translator. This will also make
it easier to keep up with the latest version of Tcl. </p>

<h3>1.1b1, 23-Apr-1996</h3>

<p>Added very limited capability to support Tk by providing an import
of Tk_Main. Had to use Tk_Eval to execute Tk commands. </p>

<h3>1.0b1</h3>

<p>First public release of TASH</p>
