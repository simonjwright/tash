This is TASH version 8.6-0, intended for use with Tcl/Tk versions 8.4
through 8.6.

In order to use this version of TASH with Tcl >= 8.5 and GCC >= 4.1,
you need to build Tcl and Tk from source and edit the following entry
from the unix/Makefiles:

AC_FLAGS   = ... lots of flags ... and:
   -DMODULE_SCOPE=extern\ __attribute__\(\(__visibility__\(\"hidden\"\)\)\)
The part
   -DMODULE_SCOPE=extern\ __attribute__\(\(__visibility__\(\"hidden\"\)\)\)
should be removed from the AC_FLAGS of both Tcl and Tk.

Then do "make clean && make" and then "make install".

This change is required because TASH depends on several symbols that
are still present in Tcl/Tk but that have been hidden.

We would like to remove the dependency on Tcl private symbols in a
future version of TASH. An alternative proposal is to remove the
'thick' binding (packages Tash and children), at any rate when the
Tcl/Tk version is later than 8.4. We suspect that the actual use of
these facilities is limited "in the field".
