This is TASH version 8.6-0, intended for use with tcl/tk versions 8.4 thru 8.6.

In order to use this version of TASH with tcl >= 8.5 and gcc >= 4.1, you need to
remove the following entry from the unix/Makefiles in your tcl and tk source build:

AC_FLAGS   = ... lots of flags ... and:  -DMODULE_SCOPE=extern\ __attribute__\(\(__visibility__\(\"hidden\"\)\)\)

The part
   -DMODULE_SCOPE=extern\ __attribute__\(\(__visibility__\(\"hidden\"\)\)\)
should be removed from the AC_FLAGS of both tcl and tk.
Then do "make clean && make" and then "make install".
This change is required because TASH depends on several symbols that are still
present in tcl/tk but that have been hidden.
We aim to remove the dependency on Tcl private symbols in a future version of TASH.
