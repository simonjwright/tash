This is TASH version 8.6-0, intended for use with Tcl/Tk versions 8.4
through 8.6.

The 'thick binding' (packages Tash.*) depends on several symbols that
are hidden in Tcl later than 8.4 if compiled with GCC later than
4.0. For this reason, the thick binding is, by default, not built if
setup.tcl finds that Tcl is later than 8.4.

In order to use the thick binding with Tcl later than 8.4 and GCC
later than 4.0, you need to build Tcl and Tk from source and edit the
following entry from the unix/Makefiles:

AC_FLAGS   = ... lots of flags ... and:
   -DMODULE_SCOPE=extern\ __attribute__\(\(__visibility__\(\"hidden\"\)\)\)
The part
   -DMODULE_SCOPE=extern\ __attribute__\(\(__visibility__\(\"hidden\"\)\)\)
should be removed from the AC_FLAGS of both Tcl and Tk.

Then do "make clean && make" and then "make install".

You can then edit the value of SUPPORTS_TASH in the setup.tcl dialog
and build TASH.

We would like to remove the dependency on Tcl private symbols in a
future version of TASH. However, we suspect that the actual use of
these facilities is limited "in the field".
