--  Limitations:  Although the underlying Tcl file I/O system supports
--                nonblocking I/O, Tash does not currently support it.
--                The primary technical problems associated with
--                implementing nonblocking read/write is that Tash
--                must start the Tcl event loop and support the Tcl
--                fileevent command.  This has been postponed so we
--                can make this new implementation of a Tash thick
--                binding available sooner.

   --  Portability Notes
   --------------------
   --
   --  Windows (all versions)
   --    Valid values for Name to open a serial port are of the form
   --    comX:, where X is a number, generally from 1 to 4. This notation
   --    only works for serial ports from 1 to 9, if the system happens
   --    to have more than four.  An attempt to open a serial port that
   --    does not exist or has a number greater than 9 will fail.  An
   --    alternate form of opening serial ports is to use the filename
   --    \\.\comX, where X is any number that corresponds to a serial port;
   --    please note that this method is considerably slower on Windows
   --    95 and Windows 98.
   --
   --  Windows NT
   --    When running Tash interactively, there may be some strange
   --    interactions between the real console, if one is present, and
   --    a command pipeline that uses standard input or output.  If a
   --    command pipeline is opened for reading, some of the lines
   --    entered at the console will be sent to the command pipeline
   --    and some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator.  If a command
   --    pipeline is opened for writing, keystrokes entered into the
   --    console are not visible until the the pipe is closed.  This
   --    behavior occurs whether the command pipeline is executing 16-bit
   --    or 32-bit applications.  These problems only occur because both
   --    Tcl and the child application are competing for the console at
   --    the same time.  If the command pipeline is started from a script,
   --    so that Tcl is not accessing the console, or if the command
   --    pipeline does not use standard input or output, but is redirected
   --    from or to a file, then the above problems do not occur.
   --
   --  Windows 95
   --    A command pipeline that executes a 16-bit DOS application
   --    cannot be opened for both reading and writing, since 16-bit
   --    DOS applications that receive standard input from a pipe and
   --    send standard output to a pipe run synchronously.  Command
   --    pipelines that do not execute 16-bit DOS applications run
   --    asynchronously and can be opened for both reading and writing.
   --    When running Tash interactively, there may be some strange
   --    interactions between the real console, if one is present, and
   --    a command pipeline that uses standard input or output.  If a
   --    command pipeline is opened for reading from a 32-bit application,
   --    some of the keystrokes entered at the console will be sent to
   --    the command pipeline and some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator.
   --    If a command pipeline is opened for writing to a 32-bit application,
   --    no output is visible on the console until the the pipe is closed.
   --    These problems only occur because both Tcl and the child
   --    application are competing for the console at the same time.
   --    If the command pipeline is started from a program, so that Tash
   --    is not accessing the console, or if the command pipeline does
   --    not use standard input or output, but is redirected from or
   --    to a file, then the above problems do not occur.
   --    Whether or not Tash is running interactively, if a command
   --    pipeline is opened for reading from a 16-bit DOS application,
   --    the call to open will not return until end-of-file has been
   --    received from the command pipeline's standard output.  If a
   --    command pipeline is opened for writing to a 16-bit DOS
   --    application, no data will be sent to the command pipeline's
   --    standard output until the pipe is actually closed.  This
   --    problem occurs because 16-bit DOS applications are run
   --    synchronously, as described above.
   --
   --  Macintosh
   --    Opening a serial port is not currently implemented under Macintosh.
   --    Opening a command pipeline is not supported under Macintosh, since
   --    applications do not support the concept of standard input or output.
   --
   --  Unix
   --    Valid values for file Name to open a serial port are generally
   --    of the form /dev/ttyX, where X is a or b, but the name of any
   --    pseudo-file that maps to a serial port may be used.
   --    When running Tash interactively, there may be some strange
   --    interactions between the console, if one is present, and a
   --    command pipeline that uses standard input.  If a command
   --    pipeline is opened for reading, some of the lines entered
   --    at the console will be sent to the command pipeline and some
   --    will be sent to the Tcl evaluator.  This problem only occurs
   --    because both Tcl and the child application are competing for
   --    the console at the same time.  If the command pipeline is
   --    started from a script, so that Tcl is not accessing the console,
   --    or if the command pipeline does not use standard input, but is
   --    redirected from a file, then the above problem does not occur.
   --
   --  See the Portability Notes section of Tash.Exec.Exec for
   --  additional information not specific to command pipelines
   --  about executing applications on the various platforms.

   procedure Close (File : in out Tash_File);
   --  Closes the channel specified by File.  All buffered output is
   --  flushed to the output device, any buffered input is discarded,
   --  the underlying file or device is closed, and Tash_File becomes
   --  unavailable for use.
   --
   --  If the Tash_File is blocking, the procedure does not return
   --  until all output is flushed.  If the Tash_File is nonblocking
   --  and there is unflushed output, the channel remains open and the
   --  procedure returns immediately; output will be flushed in the
   --  background and the Tash_File will be closed when all the flushing
   --  is complete.
   --
   --  If File is a blocking Tash_File for a command pipeline then close
   --  waits for the child processes to complete.
   --
   --  Tash_Files are automatically closed when the process exits.
   --  Tash_Files are switched to blocking mode, to ensure that all
   --  output is correctly flushed before the process exits.

   procedure Flush (File : in out Tash_File);
   --  Flushes any output that has been buffered for File.  File must be
   --  open for writing.  If the Tash_File is in blocking mode the procedure
   --  does not return until all the buffered output has been flushed to the
   --  Tash_File.  If the Tash_File is in nonblocking mode, the procedure
   --  may return before all buffered output has been flushed; the remainder
   --  will be flushed in the background as fast as the underlying file or
   --  device is able to absorb it.

   function End_Of_File (File : in Tash_File) return Boolean;
   function EOF (File : in Tash_File) return Boolean renames End_Of_File;
   --  Check for end of file on the specified Tash_File.

   function Pid (File : in Tash_File) return Tash.Lists.Tash_List;
   --  File refers to a command pipeline created with the Open procedure.
   --  Pid returns a list whose elements are the process identifiers of all
   --  the processes in the pipeline, in order.  The list will be empty if
   --  File refers to an open file that isn't a process pipeline.

   procedure New_Line (File : in Tash_File; Count : in Positive := 1);
   --  In Tash File I/O (really, in the underlying Tcl I/O system), the end
   --  of a line is always represented using a single line-feed character
   --  (ASCII.LF).  So, New_Line merely writes the specified Count number of
   --  line-feed characters to the specified File.  However, in actual files
   --  and devices, the end of a line may be represented differently on
   --  different platforms, or even for different devices on the same
   --  platform.  For example, under UNIX line-feeds are used in files,
   --  whereas carriage-return-linefeed sequences are normally used in
   --  network connections.  On input (i.e., with Get and Get_Line) the Tcl
   --  I/O system automatically translates the external end-of-line
   --  representation into line-feed characters.  Upon output (i.e., with
   --  Put and Put_Line), the I/O system translates line-feeds to the
   --  external end-of-line representation.  The default translation mode,
   --  auto, handles all the common cases automatically, but the
   --  Set_Translation_Mode procedure provides explicit control over the end
   --  of line translations.

   procedure Get (File : in Tash_File; Item : out String);
   --  Reads Item'length characters from File or to the end of the file,
   --  whichever is fewer.  If File is in nonblocking mode, the procedure
   --  may not read as many characters as requested: once all available
   --  input has been read, the procedure will return the data that is
   --  available rather than blocking for more input.

   procedure Get_Line
     (File : in Tash_File;
      Item : out String;
      Last : out Natural);
   --  Reads the next line from File, returns everything in the line up to
   --  (but not including) the end-of-line character(s), and discards the
   --  end-of-line character(s).  If end of file occurs while scanning for
   --  an end of line, the procedure returns whatever input is available up
   --  to the end of file.  If file is in nonblocking mode and there is not
   --  a full line of input available, the procedure returns an empty string
   --  and does not consume any input.

   procedure Put (File : in Tash_File; Item : in String);
   --  Writes Item to File.

   procedure Put_Line (File : in Tash_File; Item : in String);
   --  Writes Item to File, followd by the appropriate end-of-line
   --  character(s) for this platform based on the current Translation Mode.
   --
   --  Tcl buffers output internally, so characters written with Put_Line
   --  (and Put above) may not appear immediately on the output file or
   --  device; Tcl will normally delay output until the buffer is full or
   --  the Tash_File is closed.  You can force output to appear immediately
   --  with the Flush procedure.  When the output buffer fills up, the
   --  Put_Line procedure will normally block until all the buffered data
   --  has been accepted for output by the operating system.  If File is in
   --  nonblocking mode then the Put_Line procedure will not block even if
   --  the operating system cannot accept the data.  Instead, Tcl continues
   --  to buffer the data and writes it in the background as fast as the
   --  underlying file or device can accept it.  It is possible for an
   --  arbitrarily large amount of data to be buffered for a Tash_File in
   --  nonblocking mode, which could consume a large amount of memory. To
   --  avoid wasting memory, nonblocking I/O should normally be used in an
   --  event-driven fashion with the fileevent procedure (don't invoke
   --  Put_Line unless you have recently been notified via a file event that
   --  the Tash_File is ready for more output data).

   function Get_Blocking_Mode (File : in Tash_File) return Boolean;
   --  procedure Set_Blocking_Mode (
   --   File : in Tash_File;
   --   Mode : in Boolean);
   --  Get and set the blocking mode of the specified File.
   --  By default, the blocking mode of all Tash_Files is True.
   --
   --  Implementation Note:
   --    Non-blocking mode is not currently supported by Tash.
   --    In order to support non-blocking mode, Tash must start
   --    the Tcl event loop and provide a capability equivalent
   --    to the Tcl fileevent command.

   --  Set_ and Get_Encoding is not currently implemented.
   --  We need to investigate what "Normal" encoding type

   --    Encoding : in Encoding_Type);
   --  Specify the encoding of the Tash_File, so that the data can be
   --  converted to and from Unicode for use in Tcl.  For instance, in order
   --  for Tcl to read characters from a Japanese file in ShiftJIS and
   --  properly process and display the contents, the encoding would be set
   --  to ShiftJIS.  Thereafter, when reading from the Tash_File, the bytes
   --  in the Japanese file would be converted to Unicode as they are
   --  read. Writing is also supported - as Tcl strings are written to the
   --  Tash_File they will automatically be converted to the specified
   --  encoding on output.
   --
   --  If a file contains pure binary data (for instance, a JPEG image), the
   --  encoding for the Tash_File should be configured to be binary.  Tcl
   --  will then assign no interpretation to the data in the file and simply
   --  read or write raw bytes.  The Tcl binary command can be used to
   --  manipulate this byte-oriented data.
   --
   --  The default encoding for newly opened Tash_Files is the same
   --  platform- and locale-dependent system encoding used for interfacing
   --  with the operating system.

   --  In Tash File I/O (really, in the underlying Tcl I/O system), the end
   --  of a line is always represented using a single line-feed character
   --  (ASCII.LF).  However, in actual files and devices, the end of a line
   --  may be represented differently on different platforms, or even for
   --  different devices on the same platform.  For example, under UNIX
   --  line-feeds are used in files, whereas carriage-return-linefeed
   --  sequences are normally used in network connections.  On input (i.e.,
   --  with Get and Get_Line) the Tcl I/O system automatically translates
   --  the external end-of-line representation into line-feed characters.
   --  Upon output (i.e., with Put and Put_Line), the I/O system translates
   --  line-feeds to the external end-of-line representation.  The default
   --  translation mode, auto, handles all the common cases automatically,
   --  but the Set_Translation_Mode procedure provides explicit control over
   --  the end of line translations.
