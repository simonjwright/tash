--  This section describes Tash (really, Tcl) file name conventions.
--
--  INTRODUCTION
--  -============
--  All Tash subprograms that take file names as parameters expect
--  the file names to be in one of three forms, depending on the
--  current platform.  On each platform, Tcl supports file names
--  in the standard forms(s) for that platform.  In addition, on
--  all platforms, Tcl supports a Unix-like syntax intended to
--  provide a convenient way of constructing simple file names.
--  However, programs that are intended to be portable should not
--  assume a particular form for file names.  Instead, portable
--  programs must use the Split and Join subprograms to manipulate
--  file names.
--
--  PATH SYNTAX
--  -===========
--  The rules for native names depend on the value reported in the Tcl
--  array element tcl_platform(platform):
--
--  tcl_platform(platform) = "mac"
---------------------------------
--  On Apple Macintosh systems, Tcl supports two forms of path names.
--  The normal Mac style names use colons as path separators.  Paths
--  may be relative or absolute, and file names may contain any character
--  other than colon.  A leading colon causes the rest of the path to be
--  interpreted relative to the current directory.  If a path contains a
--  colon that is not at the beginning, then the path is interpreted as an
--  absolute path.  Sequences of two or more colons anywhere in the path
--  are used to construct relative paths where :: refers to the parent of
--  the current directory, ::: refers to the parent of the parent, and so
--  forth.
--
--  In addition to Macintosh style names, Tcl also supports a subset of
--  Unix-like names.  If a path contains no colons, then it is interpreted
--  like a Unix path.  Slash is used as the path separator.  The file name
--  . (dot) refers to the current directory, and .. refers to the parent
--  of the current directory.  However, some names like / or /.. have no
--  mapping, and are interpreted as Macintosh names.  In general, commands
--  that generate file names will return Macintosh style names, but commands
--  that accept file names will take both Macintosh and Unix-style names.
--
--  The following examples illustrate various forms of path names:
--
--  :               Relative path to the current folder.
--  MyFile          Relative path to a file named MyFile in the current folder.
--  MyDisk:MyFile   Absolute path to a file named MyFile on the device Named
--                    MyDisk.
--  :MyDir:MyFile   Relative path to a file name MyFile in a folder named
--                    MyDir in the current folder.
--  ::MyFile        Relative path to a file named MyFile in the folder above
--                    the current folder.
--  :::MyFile       Relative path to a file named MyFile in the folder two
--                    levels above the current folder.
--  /MyDisk/MyFile  Absolute path to a file named MyFile on the device named
--                    MyDisk.
--  ../MyFile       Relative path to a file named MyFile in the folder above
--                    the current folder.
--
--  tcl_platform(platform) = "unix"
----------------------------------
--  On Unix platforms, Tcl uses path names where the components are separated
--  by slashes.  Path names may be relative or absolute, and file names may
--  contain any character other than slash.  The file names . and .. are
--  special and refer to the current directory and the parent of the current
--  directory respectively.  Multiple adjacent slash characters are interpreted
--  as a single separator. The following examples illustrate various forms of
--  path names:
--
--  /               Absolute path to the root directory.
--  /etc/passwd     Absolute path to the file named passwd in the directory
--                    etc in the root directory.
--  .               Relative path to the current directory.
--  foo             Relative path to the file foo in the current directory.
--  foo/bar         Relative path to the file bar in the directory foo in the
--                    current directory.
--  ../foo          Relative path to the file foo in the directory above the
--                    current directory.
--
--  tcl_platform(platform) = "windows"
-------------------------------------
--  On Microsoft Windows platforms, Tcl supports both drive-relative and UNC
--  style names.  Both / and \ may be used as directory separators in either
--  type of name.  Drive-relative names consist of an optional drive specifier
--  followed by an absolute or relative path.  UNC paths follow the general
--  form \\servername\sharename\path\file.  In both forms, the file names
--  . and .. are special and refer to the current directory and the parent
--  of the current directory respectively.  The following examples illustrate
--  various forms of path names:
--
--  \\Host\share/file   Absolute UNC path to a file called file in the
--                        root directory of the export point share on
--                        the host Host.
--  c:foo               VolumeRelative path to a file foo in the current
--                        directory on drive c.
--  c:/foo              Absolute path to a file foo in the root directory
--                        of drive c.
--  foo\bar             Relative path to a file bar in the foo directory
--                        in the current directory on the current volume.
--  \foo                VolumeRelative path to a file foo in the root
--                        directory of the current volume.
--
--  TILDE SUBSTITUTION
--  -==================
--  In addition to the file name rules described above, Tcl also supports
--  csh-style tilde substitution.  If a file name starts with a tilde,
--  then the file name will be interpreted as if the first element is
--  replaced with the location of the home directory for the given user.
--  If the tilde is followed immediately by a separator, then the $HOME
--  environment variable is substituted.  Otherwise the characters between
--  the tilde and the next separator are taken as a user name, which is
--  used to retrieve the user's home directory for substitution.
--
--  The Macintosh and Windows platforms do not support tilde substitution
--  when a user name follows the tilde.  On these platforms, attempts to
--  use a tilde followed by a user name will generate an error.  File names
--  that have a tilde without a user name will be substituted using the $HOME
--  environment variable, just like for Unix.
--
--  PORTABILITY ISSUES
--  -==================
--  Not all file systems are case sensitive, so programs should avoid code
--  that depends on the case of characters in a file name.  In addition,
--  the character sets allowed on different devices may differ, so programs
--  should choose file names that do not contain special characters like:
--  <>:"/\|.  The safest approach is to use names consisting of alphanumeric
--  characters only.  Also Windows 3.1 only supports file names with a root
--  of no more than 8 characters and an extension of no more than 3
--  characters.

      return        Tash.Lists.Tash_List renames Match;
   --  Returns a list of the files whose names match Pattern.
   --    ?          Matches any single character.
   --    *          Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
   --    [chars]    Matches any single character in chars.  If chars
   --                  contains a sequence of the form a-b then any
   --                  character between a and b (inclusive) will match.
   --    \x         Matches the character x.
   --    {a,b,...}  Matches any of the strings a, b, etc.
   --
   --  If Directory is not an empty string, Match searches for files
   --  which match the Pattern starting in the given directory.  This
   --  allows searching of directories whose name contains glob-sensitive
   --  characters without the need to quote such characters explicitly.
   --  This parameter may not be used in conjunction with Path.
   --
   --  If Path_Prefix is not an empty string, Match searches for files
   --  with the given Path_Prefix where the rest of the name matches the
   --  given patterns.  This allows searching for files with names similar
   --  to a given file even when the names contain glob-sensitive characters.
   --  This parameter may not be used in conjunction with Directory.
   --
   --  If Type_List is not an empty string, Match returns a list of files
   --  where all the Type_List strings given must match.  The string
   --  elements of Type_List are "r", "w", or "x" as file permissions,
   --  and "readonly" and "hidden" as special permission cases.  On
   --  the Macintosh, MacOS types and creators are also supported,
   --  where any item which is four characters long is assumed to be a
   --  MacOS type (e.g. TEXT).  Items which are of the form
   --  "{macintosh type XXXX}" or "{macintosh creator XXXX}" will match
   --  types or creators respectively.  Unrecognised types, or specifications
   --  of multiple MacOS types/creators will signal an error.
   --  Type_List will also take a second form of type which is a string
   --  version of the File_Type: "f" for File, "d" for Directory,
   --  "c" for CharacterSpecial, "b" for BlockSpecial, "p" for Fifo,
   --  "l" for Link, "s" for Socket.
   --  The two forms may be mixed, so a Type_List of "d f r w" will
   --  find all regular files OR directories that have both read
   --  AND write permissions.
   --
   --  Portability Notes:
   --    Unlike other Tcl commands that will accept both network and
   --    native style names (see the Tcl filename manual entry for
   --    details on how native and network names are specified),
   --    Match only accepts native names.
   --
   --    Windows:
   --       For Windows UNC names, the servername and sharename
   --       components of the path may not contain ?, *, or []
   --       constructs.  On Windows NT, if pattern is of the form
   --       "~username@domain" it refers to the home directory of
   --       the user whose account information resides on the specified
   --       NT domain server.  Otherwise, user account information is
   --       obtained from the local computer.  On Windows 95 and 98,
   --       Match accepts patterns like ".../" and "..../" for
   --       successively higher up parent directories.
   --
   --   Macintosh
   --      When using the Directory or Path_Prefix parameters,
   --      Match assumes the directory separator for the entire pattern
   --      is the standard ":".  When not using these parameters
   --      (they are empty strings), Match examines each pattern
   --      argument and uses "/" unless the pattern contains a ":".
