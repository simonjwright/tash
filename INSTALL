Extract TASH
============

TASH doesn't include any special 'install' targets in its makefiles,
so the easiest place to install is in the place where you intend to
use it from.

Assuming this is your home directory, go to your home directory and
extract TASH by

  $ unzip tash-8.6-0-src-20090611.zip

and then enter the source directory:

  $ cd tash-8.6-0-src-20090611

Configure
=========

Configure for your system:
  $ ./setup.tcl

If Tcl/Tk was installed correctly, and wish is in your path, a wish
script will run which sets values for several makefile macros used to
customize your TASH build. In most cases, the default values will be
OK. If not, type in the correct values. It's important that the C
compiler used to compile glue files is compatible with your Ada
compiler; one way of achieving this (if you're using GNAT; note, these
instructions assume that's the case) is to make sure that GNAT is
first on your path.

Press the Save button to create the tash_options.gpr and makeconf files.

Build
=====

Run
  $ make all

This will build the TASH library as a static library (libtash.a) with
.ali files in lib/, and the corresponding source files in include/.

Run tests
=========

Run
  $ make test

This runs several test programs in the test/, demos/ and, with Tcl/Tk
8.4, apps/ directories.

Using TASH
==========

Make sure that the TASH distribution directory is on your
ADA_PROJECT_PATH, by eg
  $ export ADA_PROJECT_PATH=~/tash-8.6-0-src-20090611:$ADA_PROJECT_PATH

Your GPR should include TASH:
  with "tash";

The Linker package in your GPR should call up the TASH library:
  package Linker is
     for Default_Switches ("Ada") use Tash.Linker_Options;
  end Linker;
